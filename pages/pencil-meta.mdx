# Pencil Meta

A simple tool for dealing with **Vow of Forsaking**. Click a god icon below to add it to the pool of your current run, then click the boon icons to track which ones are no longer available.

<Callout>
  Note that the tool is very basic and does not account for boon requirements. A
  boon that is still lit up may not actually be in your available pool on the
  current run.
