# Lim and Oros, The Sister Blades

> The sister blades Lim and Oros were created for you; for us.\
> We reap what we sow. Remember when you put them to use.

### <TextHighlight type="legendary">Aspect of Melinoë</TextHighlight> [#melinoe]

<Boon>
Your **Attacks** and **Specials** deal more damage by striking foes from behind.

- Backstab Damage: **40%**

</Boon>

Coming soon!

### <TextHighlight type="legendary">Aspect of Artemis</TextHighlight> [#artemis]

<Boon>
While you **Channel** your **Ω Attack**, you occasionally **Parry**, then **Riposte** right after.

- Faster Omega Attack: **60%**

**Parry**: Prevent damage from most types of direct attacks. Can be repeated
after **15 Sec**. **Riposte**: You are **Impervious** for **1 Sec**. Your next
**9** strikes have **+50% Critical** chance.

</Boon>

Coming soon!

### <TextHighlight type="legendary">Aspect of Pan</TextHighlight> [#pan]

<Boon>
Your **Specials** seek foes in your **Casts**, and fire more blades after you **Channel**.

- Omega Bonus Blades: **+5**

</Boon>

#### Poseidon Special [#pan-poseidon-special]

<Boon>
  **Keepsake 1**: [Vivid Sea](/keepsakes#vivid-sea-poseidon)\
  **Special**: [Wave Flourish](/boons/poseidon#wave-flourish)\
  **Hammers**: [Spiral Knives](/weapons/sister-blades/hammers#spiral-knives),
  [Hook Knives](/weapons/sister-blades/hammers#hook-knives)
</Boon>

One of the early leaders in the meta during Early Access. This one basically
works like the Chiron bow aspect from Hades 1, but now you tag your hapless
victims with your **Cast** before hitting them with your **Ω Special**.

Poseidon is very dominant at the moment due to being the only viable flat damage
god, and the free splash damage absolutely nukes everything caught in your Cast.
Pick up the [Zeus](/boons/zeus#lightning-lance) or
[Hestia](/boons/hestia#glowing-coal) long-range cast supports for a nice quality-of-life
boost. For hammers, **Spiral Knives** takes you up to 16 homing blades and
**Hook Knives** are absolutely insane, but honestly all of the
[Special](/weapons/sister-blades/hammers#special) hammers will serve you well.
