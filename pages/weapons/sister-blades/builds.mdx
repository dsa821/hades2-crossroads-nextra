# Lim and Oros, The Sister Blades

> The sister blades Lim and Oros were created for you; for us.\
> We reap what we sow. Remember when you put them to use.

## Aspect of Melinoë [#melinoe]

<CodexEntry data={DbAspects.Blades.melinoe}>
Your **Attacks** and **Specials** deal more damage by striking foes from behind.

- Backstab Damage: **40%**

</CodexEntry>

Coming soon!

## Aspect of Artemis [#artemis]

<CodexEntry data={DbAspects.Blades.artemis}>
While you **Channel** your **Ω Attack**, you occasionally **Parry**, then **Riposte** right after.

- Faster Omega Attack: **60%**

**Parry**: Prevent damage from most types of direct attacks. Can be repeated after **15 Sec**.\
**Riposte**: You are **Impervious** for **1 Sec**. Your next **9** strikes have 50% Critical\*\* chance.

</CodexEntry>

Coming soon!

## Aspect of Pan [#pan]

<CodexEntry data={DbAspects.Blades.pan}>
Your **Specials** seek foes in your **Casts**, and fire more blades after you **Channel**.

- Omega Bonus Blades: **+5**

</CodexEntry>

One of the early leaders in the meta during Early Access. This one basically works like the Chiron bow aspect from Hades 1, but now you tag your hapless victims with your **Cast** before hitting them with your **Ω Special**.

### Poseidon Special [#pan-poseidon-special]

<Build>
  <Build.Arcana>
    [Sorceress](/arcana#sorceress)
    [Death](/arcana#death)
  </Build.Arcana>
  
  <Build.Keepsakes>
    [Vivid Sea](/keepsakes#vivid-sea-poseidon)
  </Build.Keepsakes>

  <Build.Moves>
    <Build.Moves.Core>
      [Wave Flourish](/boons/poseidon#wave-flourish)
    </Build.Moves.Core>

    <Build.Moves.Support>
      [Slippery Slope](/boons/poseidon#slippery-slope)
    </Build.Moves.Support>

  </Build.Moves>

  <Build.Hammers>
    [Spiral Knives](/weapons/sister-blades/hammers#spiral-knives),
    [Hook Knives](/weapons/sister-blades/hammers#hook-knives)
  </Build.Hammers>  
</Build>

Poseidon is very dominant at the moment due to being the only viable flat damage god, and the free splash damage absolutely nukes everything caught in Cast.

Pick up the [Zeus](/boons/zeus#lightning-lance) or [Hestia](/boons/hestia#glowing-coal) long-range cast supports for a nice quality-of-life boost. For hammers, **Spiral Knives** takes you up to 16 homing blades and **Hook Knives** are absolutely insane, but honestly all of the [Special](/weapons/sister-blades/hammers#special) hammers will serve you well.
