# Descura, The Witch's Staff

#### Poseidon Special [#momus-poseidon-special]

<Boon>
  **Keepsake 1**: [Vivid Sea](/keepsakes#vivid-sea-poseidon)\
  **Special**: [Wave Flourish](/boons/poseidon#wave-flourish)\
  **Hammers**: [Double Moonshot](/weapons/witchs-staff/hammers#double-moonshot),
  [Shimmering Moonshot](/weapons/witchs-staff/hammers#shimmering-moonshot),
  [Rapid Moonfire](/weapons/witchs-staff/hammers#rapid-moonfire)
</Boon>

Currently dominating Early Access along with
[Pan](/weapons/sister-blades/builds/#pan-poseidon-special), it's almost
certainly getting nerfed due to the power and more importantly the braindead
playstyle. The Momus playstyle currently means completely ignoring the **Ω Special**
and instead spamming regular **Specials** due to the massive base damage increase.

The high rate of fire on the Staff Special makes it an ideal candidate for Poseidon's big flat damage boons.
Poseidon also happens to give you AOE and knockback, allowing you to stay at very far range and
do nothing but spam Specials to your heart's content. The **Double Moonshot** hammer is the
other game-breaking synergy of this build, literally doubling your damage and making
it so you don't even have to aim any more. Enjoy it while it lasts, because it almost
certainly won't make it to release.
