# Descura, The Witch's Staff

> Amongst the Nocturnal Arms, Descura was first to wake when you approached. She is yours.\
> How does it feel to wield her, something which should never have been used? Forged in Chaos as a last resort, to bring her brother-arms to heel if need arose.

<CodexEntry data={DbAspects.Staff.melinoe}>

<CodexEntry data={DbAspects.Staff.circe}>

</CodexEntry>

Coming soon!

## Aspect of Momus [#momus]

<CodexEntry data={DbAspects.Staff.momus}>
While you have no more than **50%** <IconLife />, absorb your **Ω Special** blast to restore **5** <IconLife />.

- Special & Omega Special Power: **+30**

</CodexEntry>

Currently dominating Early Access along with [Pan](/weapons/sister-blades/builds/#pan-poseidon-special), it's almost certainly getting nerfed due to the power and more importantly the braindead playstyle. The Momus playstyle currently means completely ignoring the **Ω Special** and instead spamming the regular **Special** due to the massive base damage increase.

### Poseidon Special [#momus-poseidon-special]

<Build>
  {/* <Build.Arcana>
    [Huntress](/arcana#the-huntress)
  </Build.Arcana> */}
  
  <Build.Keepsakes data={[
    DbKeepsakes.vividSea,
    DbKeepsakes.whiteAntler
  ]} />

  <Build.Moves>
    <Build.Moves.Core data={[
      DbBoons.Poseidon.waveFlourish
    ]} />

    <Build.Moves.Support data={[
      DbBoons.Poseidon.slipperySlope,
      DbBoons.Poseidon.crashingWave,
      DbBoons.Poseidon.kingTide,
      DbBoons.Zeus.staticShock,
      DbBoons.Artemis.supportFire
    ]} />

  </Build.Moves>

  <Build.Hammers data={[
    DbHammers.Staff.doubleMoonshot,
    DbHammers.Staff.shimmeringMoonshot,
    DbHammers.Staff.rapidMoonfire
  ]} />  
</Build>

The high rate of fire on the Staff Special makes it an ideal candidate for Poseidon's big flat damage boons. Poseidon also happens to give you AOE and knockback, allowing you to stay at very far range and do nothing but spam Specials to your heart's content. The [Double Moonshot](/weapons/witchs-staff/hammers#double-moonshot) hammer is the other game-breaking synergy of this build, literally doubling your damage and making it so you don't even have to aim any more. Enjoy it while it lasts, because it almost certainly won't make it to release.
