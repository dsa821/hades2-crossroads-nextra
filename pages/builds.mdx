## Archetypes

Some common builds that you may see popping up on multiple aspects:

### Triple Earth

This means targeting all the gods with <IconEarth /> boons ([Hera](/boons/hera), [Demeter](/boons/demeter), and [Hephaestus](/boons/hephaestus)). Three earth gods makes it easy to unlock the powerful Demeter defensive infusion [Coarse Grit](/boons/demeter#coarse-grit), not to mention [Artemis](/boons/artemis) and [Hermes](/boons/hermes) have earth boons as well. Add in Demeter's Freeze curse (often on [cast](/boons/demeter#arctic-ring)) and sprinkle in some defensive Hephaestus support boons ([Trusty Shield](/boons/hephaestus#trusty-shield), [Mint Condition](/boons/hephaestus#mint-condition), [Heavy Metal](/boons/hephaestus#heavy-metal), [Uncanny Fortitude](/boons/hephaestus#uncanny-fortitude)) and you have an extremely strong defensive foundation.

For offense, Hera's attack and special do respectable single target damage, her Hitch curse adds great AOE potential, and it also helps activate [Origination](/arcana#origination) along with the aforementioned Freeze curse. The cherry on top is that you get access to the [best Gain ability](/boons/hera#born-gain) as well as the infusions [Proper Upbringing](/boons/hera#proper-upbringing) and [Martial Art](/boons/hephaestus#martial-art). You may even get a shot at [Brave Face](/boons/hera#brave-face) and [Spiteful Strength](/boons/hera#spiteful-strength-hephaestus) if you plan for it.
