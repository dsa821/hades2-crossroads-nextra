# General Tips

This guide assumes that you are familiar with the basics of Hades. Here are some not-as-obvious tips for players who may be newer to trying to create their own builds.

## Primary Damage Sources

It's usually best to focus on a single move as your primary source of damage for a given run. The main damage options in **Hades 2** are:

- Attack
- Special
- Cast (not really a viable option at the moment, 立 Cast is the real damage
  bringer)
- 立 Attack
- 立 Special
- 立 Cast

There will be meme builds floating around like Revenge or perhaps Sprint-based builds eventually, these are really the core options for serious builds. Read what your chosen aspect does and it's pretty obvious what move it wants to build around.

## Fast vs. Slow Weapons

There are 4 gods who grant percent-based damage boons ([Hera](/boons/hera), [Demeter](/boons/demeter), [Apollo](/boons/apollo), and [Aphrodite](/boons/aphrodite)). They are generally more suited for slower moves.

The remaining 4 gods are supposed to be built around flat damage boons ([Zeus](/boons/zeus), [Poseidon](/boons/poseidon), [Hephaestus](/boons/hephaestus), and [Hestia](/boons/hestia)). This would make them suited to fast moves on paper. However, in early access, the current mechanics of each god is such that only Poseidon is really offering straightforward flat damage. Consequently, you will see Poseidon dominating the early access meta on fast weapons like [Momus](/weapons/witchs-staff/builds#momus) and [Pan](/weapons/sister-blades/builds#pan).

## The God Pool

This just means how many primary gods/goddesses you will see boons from on a
given run (Artemis and Hermes don't count, as they are purely supports). In
**Hades 1**, this number was **4**, whereas in **Hades 2**, the god pool seems
to be **3**. It is possible to go over that if you are using
[God Keepsakes](/keepsakes#olympians) (letting you force a 4th god after you've
already picked up boons from 3), but it's generally inadvisable because it makes
for a stronger build to focus on 2 or 3 gods.

## Infusions

Infusions are a new mechanic introduced in **Hades 2**. Each boon has an element
associated with it, and if you pick up an Infusion boon and have enough elements
to meet the requirement, you can unlock some strong bonuses. Taking the God Pool
mechanic into account, this means it's even more important to choose what gods
you want to focus on and consider what elements they share.

## Keepsakes

It is extremely helpful to switch [Keepsakes](/keepsakes) between biomes. Since
many builds have specific boons in mind that they want to build around, a very
common keepsake pattern might be something like this:

- **Erebus**: God Keepsake 1 (usually whatever you want buffing your primary
  damage source)
- **Oceanus**: God Keepsake 2 (something complementary to God 1, or maybe trying
  to set up for a key <TextHighlight type="duo">**Duo**</TextHighlight> boon).
  If you don't need a 2nd God Keepsake, you might try something like
  [Aromatic Phial](/keepsakes#aromatic-phial) or
  [Gold Purse](/keepsakes#gold-purse).
- **Fields of Mourning**: By now, you want to move to a non-God Keepsake to avoid
  diluting your God Pool. This is really dealer's choice but some common options
  might be [Transcendent Embryo](/keepsakes#transcendent-embryo),
  [Experimental Hammer](/keepsakes#experimental-hammer), or
  [Blackened Fleece](/keepsakes#blackened-fleece)
- **Tartarus**: Within striking range of Chronos, many more options open up
  because the limited-use keepsakes will last you through the rest of the run.
  Some examples are [Metallic Droplet](/keepsakes#metallic-droplet),
  [Silver Wheel](/keepsakes#silver-wheel), or [Lion Fang](/keepsakes#lion-fang).
  Another popular choice is to add a strong defensive keepsake if you need the
  help against Chronos, such as [Knuckle Bones](/keepsakes#knuckle-bones),
  [Luckier Tooth](/keepsakes#luckier-tooth), or
  [Engraved Pin](/keepsakes#engraved-pin).

## Daedalus Hammers

The game will try very hard to give you **2** <IconHammer /> per run: the first
in **Erebus** (the first biome), and the second by the **Fields of Mourning** (the
third biome). Many builds get huge power boosts from hammers, so make sure you
choose these when they are an option.

The caveat to this is to avoid buying them at Charon's shop, since the game will
try to give you another hammer for free eventually.

<Callout>
  Side note: it is possible for **Echo** to give you a third hammer. If you
  haven't reached her room yet in the **Fields of Mourning**, make sure you try
  and pick up any hammers (it should be your second one of the run) as the last
  thing in the room, so that she can echo it as your previous reward.

## Damage Formula

All +% damage buffs in Hades 2 are **additive**, not **multiplicative**. Consider the following examples assuming 20 base damage and two separate damage buffs of +50% each.

```js
// ADDITIVE
20 + (20 * 0.5) + (20 * 0.5) = 40

// MULTIPLICATIVE
20 * 1.5 * 1.5 = 45
```

What this means in practical terms is that with additive damage, you will start seeing diminishing returns. For example:

```js
// 300% worth of damage buffs
20 + (20 * 3) = 80

// Adding another 50% buff
20 + (20 * 3) + (20 * 0.5) = 90
```
 The next +50% buff you find is only adding 10 more damage because of the base 20 damage.

This also makes **+ Power** effects very strong because they increase your base damage (things like [Moon](/arcana#moon), [Slow Cooker](/boons/hestia#slow-cooker), or [Aspect of Momus](/weapons/witchs-staff/builds/#momus)). Adding a **+10 Power** buff instead of **+50%** to the previous example:

```js
30 + (30 * 3) = 120
```
