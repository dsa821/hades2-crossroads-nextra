import { Cards, Card, Callout } from "nextra/components";

A build compendium for Hades 2, inspired by [Lee Reamsnyder's excellent build guides](https://www.leereamsnyder.com/hades-build-guide) for the original Hades.

<Callout>
  During Early Access, I don't plan on putting too many builds up due to the high likelihood of balance changes as well as encouraging people to try things for themselves. Early Access should be about exploring and playing around, not following build guides!
</Callout>

If you are newer to Hades, I recommend starting [here](/general) for a basic intro on various game mechanics that influence how to make a build.
Otherwise, jump right in to the builds below!

<Cards>
  <Card title="Witch's Staff" href="/weapons/witchs-staff/builds" />
  <Card title="Sister Blades" href="/weapons/sister-blades/builds" />
  <Card title="Umbral Flames" href="/weapons/umbral-flames/builds" />
  <Card title="Moonstone Axe" href="/weapons/moonstone-axe/builds" />
  <Card title="Argent Skull" href="/weapons/argent-skull/builds" />
</Cards>
